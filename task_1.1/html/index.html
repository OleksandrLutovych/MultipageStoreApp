                    <p class="infoText">Richard Hugh Blackmore (born 14 April 1945) is an English guitarist and songwriter.He was a founding member of Deep Purple in 1968, playing jam-style hard rock music that mixed guitar riffs and organ sounds.He is prolific in creating guitar riffs and classically influenced solos.</p>
                    <p class="infoText">During his solo career, Blackmore established the heavy metal band Rainbow,[6] which fused baroque music influences and elements of hard rock. Rainbow steadily moved to catchy pop-style mainstream rock. He later formed the traditional folk rock project Blackmore's Night along with his now wife Candice Night, shifting to vocalist-centred sounds.</p>
                    <p class="infoText">As a member of Deep Purple, Blackmore was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2016. He is cited by publications such as Guitar World and Rolling Stone as one of the greatest and most influential guitar players of all time.</p>
